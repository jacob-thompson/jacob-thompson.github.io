This is a CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator that I made in C using the SDL2 library. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that was used to make games. It was originally developed to run on some older computers, such as the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. This interpreter can run CHIP-8 games at configurable execution speeds. The interpreter can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacob-thompson/chip-8).

`pathfinder` is a program that visualizes pathfinding algorithms in a customizable space. It allows users to set start and end points, create obstacles, and choose from various algorithms to see how they navigate the environment. The source code for the project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacob-thompson/pathfinder).

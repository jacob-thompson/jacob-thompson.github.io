`teal8` is a CHIP-8 interpreter/emulator that I made in pure C. CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language that was used to make games. It was originally developed to run on some older computers, such as the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. This interpreter can run CHIP-8 games at configurable execution speeds. The source code for the interpreter can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/jacob-thompson/teal8).

Welcome to my personal website! I am a student at Modesto Junior College studying Computer Science. I am interested in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Web Development, and Game Development. I have experience using Python, C, C++, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL. I utilize many tools in my workflow, including Git, Github, Vim, Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Slack, Discord, Zoom, Microsoft Office, and Google Suite. I am looking for opportunities to gain experience in the tech industry. I am also looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working with me.

I am a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz studying Computer Science. I am interested in Data Science, Hardware Emulation, and Game Development. I have experience using Python, C, C++, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL. I am looking for opportunities to gain experience in the industry. I am also looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working with me.

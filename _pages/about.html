I am a student at the University of California, Santa Cruz studying Computer Science.
I am interested in Data Science, Hardware Emulation, and Game Development.
I have experience using Python, C, C++, Lua, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and SQL.
I am looking for opportunities to gain experience in the industry.
I am also looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects.
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in working with me.

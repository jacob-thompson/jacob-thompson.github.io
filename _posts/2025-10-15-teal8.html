            CHIP-8 is a language interpreter that allowed for easy game programming.
            It was used in the 70s and 80s on computers
                such as the COSMAC VIP and the TELMAC 1800.
            The interpreter is very small due to the memory limitations
                of these computers, as the COSMAC VIP had 2K and the TELMAC 1800 had 4K.

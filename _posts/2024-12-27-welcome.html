        <p>
            I plan to use this blog to document my development journey. I'll be writing about the things I learn, the projects I work on, and the things I find interesting.

            What is next?
        </h2>
        <p>
            I will write about some of the projects I have worked on in the past. After that, I will write about the projects that I am either currently working on, or plan on working on in the future.
